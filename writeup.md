## Writeup Project 5

---

**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Data Set

The training data from the KITTI and DTI databases. They are divided into "car" and "not car" samples. Here is one example of each:

![vehicle][vehicleExample]
![not vehicle][notvehicleExample]

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Extracing HOG features

HOG is useful as it not only takes the gradient (which we know from lane finding is an effective way to find lines) it also preserves information about the direction of the gradient. This makes it easier to identify shapes. Here is an example of what the HOG looks like for a vehicle image:

#### 2. HOG parameters.

I left the `skimage.hog()` parameter orientations at 9, pixels_per_cell at 9, and cells_per_block at 2. It's possible to get more granular features and better prediction accuracy by changing the parameters, but it came at the cost of more time to compute the HOG. These parameter values give sufficient accuracy and take less time (though it still isn't fast).

I transformed the images to the HSV color space and used the S channel to compute the gradient. The s channel proved the best at picking out the shape of the car.

### Color features

I also extracted features from the color information in the images. The first is just the spatial positioning of the colors. This means just taking the image and lining up the pixels from top left to bottom right.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
